According to the United Nations, 963 million people - almost one in six inhabitants of our planet - are seriously malnourished. At present, the right to food is surely, of all human rights, the one that is violated with the most impunity. Jean Ziegler argues that hunger is caused by human injustice and assures that today the world could produce enough food to feed the world's population. Among the main causes of this disaster, Ziegler points to stock market speculation, which forces cereal prices to rise, and the appearance of biofuels as a new source of energy. Burning food to keep millions of cars on the roads is a crime against humanity. Hunger is no inescapable destiny. A starving child is killed. The current world order of globalized financial capitalism is not only deadly, it is also absurd.

According to the United Nations, 963 million people - almost one in six inhabitants of our planet - are seriously malnourished. At present, the right to food is surely, of all human rights, the one that is violated with the most impunity. Jean Ziegler argues that hunger is caused by human injustice and assures that today the world could produce enough food to feed the world's population. Among the main causes of this disaster, Ziegler points to stock market speculation, which forces cereal prices to rise, and the appearance of biofuels as a new source of energy. Burning food to keep millions of cars on the roads is a crime against humanity. Hunger is no inescapable destiny. A starving child is killed. The current world order of globalized financial capitalism is not only deadly, it is also absurd.

760495,"Dancing in the Street, 11 grados de separación","After having shared a common experience in Cuba, twelve filmmakers say goodbye to return to their countries and make a pact: to make a collective film that answers the questions: what does it mean to plagiarize images and how to do it in the distance? The mechanism is unusual: a director makes a short and sends it to the next director, who in turn makes his own short for the purpose of plagiarizing the one he received. And so the chain of plagiarism continues until it reaches the last one. Each one interprets in their own way what it means to plagiarize the received film. The first link in the chain is James Benning, one of the world's most patient filmmakers. His extensive plans are replicated in the following fragments. Disobedience moves the exercise away from literality and an exploration of the texture of the images begins. In its repetitive mechanism, we can see that cinema is, in addition to record of  reality, an art of images and sound. (Santiago González Cragnolino)",0.007142200996598031,,[99],0.0,[]

These are like multiple echoes that resemble waves in the water or stars in the sky. "" Behind these images and sounds that have been stifled by today's society, Lehman hunts for noises, cries, songs, messages that go astray. He says that if we look at the invisible we may hear the words. He invites us to look beyond the appearances of social life and to vibrate in tune with life's polyphony that is all around us.""",0.00216547851963219,/j5PdMj0PccymmqFip3GQf9GIA7l.jpg,[99],0.7000000000000001,[]

204709,The Scapegoat,"There is something strange - some would even say abnormal - about the Malaussène family.
